# Object-Oriented-House
 a program that models houses, doors, and people

## Problem Statement 
The program creates a class hierarchy that models houses, doors, and people. The implemented classes contain appropriate attributes, constructors, methods, and behaviors to represent these entities accurately.

## User Documentation
This program can be used to gain a better understanding of how hierarchy and inheritance works in Java. The user can edit the main executable file to test class instances and their methods. 

## Developer Documentation
The House class is the parent class for dwelling spaces such as Small Apartment. House has various attributes including a door from the Door class. House and Door are have default parameters. The Person class has no default parameters, so all parameters must be accounted for. The HouseClassHierarchy class is for the user to experiment with.
